|*  This is a place to configure permissions   *|
|*  for all admin commands or individual admin *|
|*  commands. This permissions system is based *|
|*  on discord roles. You may only use role    *|
|*  ids, but I may implement names in the      *|
|*  future. Soon:tm:                           *|
